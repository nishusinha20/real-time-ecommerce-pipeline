## 🏗️ **Architecture & Design Q&A**

### **Q: "Walk me through your data architecture."**
**A:** Our architecture follows the modern data stack pattern:

```
Data Sources → Data Lake → Processing → Data Warehouse → Analytics
     ↓            ↓           ↓            ↓              ↓
E-commerce    MinIO/S3    Apache Spark  ClickHouse    Power BI/
   APIs       (Raw Data)   (ETL/ELT)   (Analytics)   Grafana
```

**Key Design Principles:**
- **Separation of Concerns**: Each layer has a specific responsibility
- **Scalability**: Horizontal scaling with distributed processing
- **Reliability**: Fault tolerance and error handling

## 📊 **Data Pipeline Q&A**

### **Q: "Explain the difference between batch and streaming processing."**
**A:** 

**Batch Processing:**
- Processes data in chunks/batches
- Runs on a schedule (hourly, daily, weekly)
- Good for large volumes of historical data
- Example: Daily sales reports, monthly analytics

**Streaming Processing:**
- Processes data in real-time as it arrives
- Continuous processing with low latency
- Good for real-time analytics and alerts
- Example: Real-time fraud detection, live dashboards

**Our Implementation:**
- **Batch**: Generate daily transaction files, process with Spark
- **Streaming**: Real-time user events via Kafka, process with Spark Streaming
- **Hybrid**: Lambda architecture combining both approaches

### **Q: "What's the difference between ETL and ELT?"**
**A:**

**ETL (Extract, Transform, Load):**
- Transform data before loading into warehouse
- Requires predefined schemas
- Good for structured, predictable data
- Traditional approach

**ELT (Extract, Load, Transform):**
- Load raw data first, then transform
- More flexible for schema evolution
- Better for unstructured data
- Modern cloud-native approach

**Our Approach:**
- **Extract**: Collect data from various sources
- **Load**: Store raw data in data lake (MinIO)
- **Transform**: Process with Spark, store in warehouse (ClickHouse)

### **Q: "How do you handle data quality issues?"**
**A:** We implement a comprehensive data quality framework:

**Data Validation:**
- Schema validation (JSON schema, CSV headers)
- Data type checks (integers, dates, strings)
- Range validation (prices > 0, ages 18-100)
- Format validation (email patterns, phone numbers)

**Data Profiling:**
- Statistical analysis of data distributions
- Missing value detection
- Duplicate identification
- Outlier detection

**Monitoring & Alerting:**
- Track data quality metrics over time
- Alert on quality threshold breaches
- Dashboard for quality trends
- Automated data quality reports

**Data Quality Tools:**
- Great Expectations for validation
- Pandera for schema validation
- Custom quality checks in Spark
- Data quality scoring

## 🔧 **Technical Implementation Q&A**

### **Q: "How does your data ingestion work?"**
**A:** Our ingestion pipeline handles multiple data types:

**Batch Ingestion:**
```python
# Read JSON files from data lake
user_events = spark.read.json("s3://data-lake/raw/user_events/")
transactions = spark.read.json("s3://data-lake/raw/transactions/")

# Validate and clean data
clean_events = user_events.filter(col("user_id").isNotNull())
clean_transactions = transactions.filter(col("amount") > 0)
```

**Streaming Ingestion:**
```python
# Read from Kafka topics
streaming_events = spark.readStream \
    .format("kafka") \
    .option("kafka.bootstrap.servers", "kafka:9092") \
    .option("subscribe", "user-events") \
    .load()
```

**Data Validation:**
- Schema validation on ingestion
- Data type conversion
- Null value handling
- Duplicate detection

### **Q: "How do you handle schema evolution?"**
**A:** Schema evolution is critical for long-running pipelines:

**Schema Registry:**
- Track schema versions over time
- Validate schema compatibility
- Manage schema migrations

**Backward Compatibility:**
- New schemas must be backward compatible
- Optional fields for new data
- Default values for missing fields

**Migration Strategy:**
- Version data with schema version
- Transform data when schemas change
- Maintain multiple schema versions
- Gradual migration approach

**Example:**
```python
# Handle schema evolution in Spark
df = spark.read.option("mergeSchema", "true") \
    .parquet("s3://data-lake/processed/")

# Add new columns with defaults
df = df.withColumn("new_field", lit(None))
```
